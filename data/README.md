# Phase 1: Data Preparation

 * Format System Prompt – Ensure the system prompt with rules and specifications is well-structured and stored in a way that is easy to incorporate during training.
 * Curate the Dataset – Validate and preprocess the triplet dataset (user input, metadata, correct workflow).
 * Data Augmentation (Optional) – Generate additional training samples by paraphrasing user inputs, introducing minor variations, or augmenting metadata.
   + Split the Dataset – Divide the dataset into:
   + Training Set (80%) – Used for learning.
   + Validation Set (10%) – Used to tune hyperparameters.
   + Test Set (10%) – Used to evaluate generalization.
 * Tokenization and Encoding – Convert input, metadata, and workflows into a structured format compatible with your model.

# Phase 2: Model Selection & Setup

 * Choose a Base Model – Select a small transformer-based model (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA, Mistral) or train from scratch.
 * Define Input-Output Mapping – Decide whether to treat this as:
 * A seq-to-seq problem (like machine translation).
 * A text-to-structured-output problem (like code generation).
 * Set Up the Training Environment – Configure GPU/TPU resources, framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), and dependencies.

# Phase 3: Training the Model

## Train the Model on the Specification First (Phase 1)

Before exposing the model to real user queries, fine-tune it to explicitly learn the Tamarind workflow rules.

How to do this?
 * Format the specification as structured data, FAQ-style text, or JSON.
 * Create a dataset that teaches the model by asking it questions about the workflow language.

```json
{
  "input": "What are the mandatory fields in a Tamarind workflow step?",
  "metadata": {},
  "expected_response": "Each workflow step must include an 'action', 'parameters', and optionally 'conditions'."
}
```

```json
{
  "input": "Can a variable be declared outside of a step?",
  "metadata": {},
  "expected_response": "Yes, variables can be declared at the workflow level using the '@var' syntax."
}
```

 * Train the model using text completion or multiple-choice question-style fine-tuning.
 * Purpose: This phase ensures that the model understands the language before it starts seeing examples of workflows.

## Train the Model on Real User Queries with Correct Workflows (Phase 2)

Now, once the model has a foundational understanding of the Tamarind workflow language, train it using synthetic examples that demonstrate correct outputs.

How to do this?
 * Prepare a dataset of triplets: ("user input", "metadata", "correct workflow").
 * Ensure the dataset covers:
   * Basic and simple cases (e.g., single-step workflows).
   * Complex workflows (multi-step logic).
   * Edge cases (error handling, unusual user inputs).
* Example:

```json
{
  "input": "Read a JSON file and filter rows where status='active'",
  "metadata": {"file_format": "JSON"},
  "expected_workflow": {
    "steps": [
      {"action": "read_json", "parameters": {"file": "@var:file_path"}},
      {"action": "filter", "parameters": {"condition": "status == 'active'"}}
    ]
  }
}
```

 * Train the model using sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) fine-tuning to map input + metadata to correct workflows.

## 3. Validation and Iteration

 
 * After training, evaluate on a held-out validation set.
 * If the model generates incorrect workflows:
 * Check if the mistake comes from misunderstanding the rules → Reinforce Phase 1.
 * If it's a syntax error → Reinforce Phase 2 with more examples.
 * Optionally, use reinforcement learning (RLHF) where humans provide feedback to correct the generated workflows.

# Phase 4: Evaluation & Iteration
  + Evaluate Performance – Use the test set to measure performance against key metrics:
  + Accuracy (Does it generate the correct workflow?)
  + BLEU Score / ROUGE Score (Measures similarity to reference outputs)
  + Syntax & Execution Validity (Ensures outputs follow Tamarind workflow rules)
  + Error Analysis & Debugging – Identify failure cases, retrain on errors, and refine the dataset.
  + Iterate on Model Improvements – Adjust data, prompt design, or architecture as needed.
# Phase 5: Deployment & Integration

 
  + Convert to an Optimized Format – If needed, quantize or optimize for efficient inference.
  + Test in a Real Environment – Deploy a prototype version for testing in real-world use cases.
  + Monitor Performance in Production – Track model behavior, log incorrect outputs, and continuously improve.
